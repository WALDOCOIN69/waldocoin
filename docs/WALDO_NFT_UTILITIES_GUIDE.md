## 🥉 Holder Tier System

### Tier Levels

| Tier | NFTs Required | Share Multiplier | XP Boost | Fee Discount | Voting Power |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 👑 **Platinum** | 10+ | 5× | +25% | 15% | 1.5× |
| 🥇 **Gold** | 3-9 | 2× | +15% | 10% | 1.25× |
| 🥈 **Silver** | 1-2 | 1× | +10% | 5% | 1.1× |
| ⚪ **Non-Holder** | 0 | 0× | 0% | 0% | 1.0× |

### How It Works

- **Automatic Detection** - System checks wallet NFT count on every action
- **Real-Time Updates** - Tier changes instantly when NFTs are minted/sold
- **Stackable Benefits** - All benefits apply simultaneously
- **No Claiming Required** - Benefits are automatic

### Example

```
User has 5 NFTs → Gold Tier
- Earns 2× shares in monthly reward pool
- Gets +15% XP boost on all memes
- Pays 10% less on claim fees
- Gets 1.25× voting power in DAO
```

## 💰 Revenue-Share Pool (Holder Yield)

### Monthly Reward Distribution

**Pool Funding:**
- 2% of all WALDO transaction fees
- 1% of staking pool profits
- Royalties from secondary NFT sales

**Distribution Method:**
- Snapshot taken on 1st of each month
- Pro-rata distribution based on tier shares
- Automatic WALDO airdrop to wallets

### Example Distribution

```
Total Pool: 10,000 WALDO
Total Shares: 100

Platinum Holder (5 NFTs) = 5 shares
  Reward = (5/100) × 10,000 = 500 WALDO

Gold Holder (3 NFTs) = 2 shares
  Reward = (2/100) × 10,000 = 200 WALDO

Silver Holder (1 NFT) = 1 share
  Reward = (1/100) × 10,000 = 100 WALDO
```

### Claiming Rewards

```javascript
// Automatic - no action needed
// Rewards appear in wallet pending balance
// Can be claimed with other WALDO earnings
```

---

## 🚀 XP Boost System

### How It Works

When a user with NFTs earns XP from memes:

```
Base XP: 10
Holder Tier: Gold (+15%)
Boosted XP: 10 × 1.15 = 11.5 → 11 XP

Total Earned: 11 XP (1 bonus XP)
```

### Boost Percentages

- **Platinum (10+ NFTs):** +25% XP
- **Gold (3-9 NFTs):** +15% XP
- **Silver (1-2 NFTs):** +10% XP
- **Non-Holder:** 0% XP

### Benefits

✅ Reach 60 XP faster for NFT minting
✅ Earn more rewards from memes
✅ Accelerate progression
✅ Compound with engagement metrics

## 💳 Claim Fee Discounts

### Fee Structure

**Standard Fees:**
- Instant Claim: 10%
- Staked Claim: 5%

**With NFT Discount:**

| Gold | 9% | 4.75% |
| Silver | 9.5% | 4.75% |
| Non-Holder | 10% | 5% |

### Example

```
Claiming 1,000 WALDO (Instant)

Non-Holder: 1,000 - 100 (10%) = 900 WALDO
Gold Holder: 1,000 - 90 (9%) = 910 WALDO
Platinum Holder: 1,000 - 85 (8.5%) = 915 WALDO

Platinum saves: 15 WALDO per claim
```
