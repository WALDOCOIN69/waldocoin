# 🛡️ WALDOCOIN Anti-Farming Protection System

## 🚨 **PROBLEM: Like Farming with Gibberish**

### **Farming Attempts We Block:**
```
❌ "asdfjkl qwerty" (gibberish)
❌ "nice" (single word farming)
❌ "lol" (generic reaction)
❌ "to the moon" (crypto cliché)
❌ "🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀" (emoji spam)
❌ "AAAAAAAA" (character repetition)
❌ "123456789" (random numbers)
❌ "test test test" (word repetition)
❌ Retweets/Quote tweets (reposts)
❌ Replies to other tweets
❌ "@username thanks!" (reply patterns)
```

### **Quality Content We Reward:**
```
✅ "When you realize you've been hodling the wrong coin this whole time 😅"
✅ "That moment when your portfolio is down but your meme game is strong 💪"
✅ "Me trying to explain crypto to my parents for the 100th time 🤦‍♂️"
✅ "POV: You're checking your portfolio at 3am again 📱"
✅ "This meme perfectly captures my trading strategy: pure chaos 🎯"
✅ "When someone asks if I'm winning in crypto... *shows meme* 📈"
```

**Note**: Memes can be about ANYTHING - crypto, life, humor, relatable moments. No specific topic required!
