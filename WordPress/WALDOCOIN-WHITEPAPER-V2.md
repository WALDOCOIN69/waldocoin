**Important Disclosure:** WALDO MNFTs are digital collectibles with ecosystem utility. Any WALDO token allocations associated with NFT ownership are discretionary, variable, and non-guaranteed. These allocations do not represent revenue sharing, profit participation, dividends, or investment returns. NFT ownership does not create a partnership, ownership interest, or financial claim against WALDO or its operators. Allocations may increase, decrease, or be discontinued at any time.

In short: Don't bet your life savings, don't sue us, and most importantly, have fun.

---

## 3. What is WALDOcoin?

WALDOcoin is a content-driven cryptocurrency that rewards users for engagement on social platforms. Built on the XRPL (XRP Ledger), WALDOcoin enables seamless transactions, low fees, and scalable reward distribution.

The token operates on an engagement-based earning model where users earn WALDOcoin based on likes, retweets, and other engagement metrics. Users can choose between instant payouts with a 10% fee or staking rewards with a 15% bonus. The tokenomics are structured with reward caps and burn mechanisms to ensure sustainability, all running on XRPL infrastructure that is decentralized, scalable, and environmentally friendly.

The token symbol is WLO with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens at 6 decimal places. The issuer wallet has been blackholed, meaning the Regular Key was set to the blackhole address and the Master Key was disabled. No new tokens can ever be created.

---

## 4. Getting Started

To begin earning with WALDOcoin, users first connect their Xaman Wallet to the WALDO dashboard and link their Twitter/X account for meme tracking. From there, they can create memes using the Memeology template library or post directly to X. As engagement grows through likes and retweets, users earn XP and can claim their rewards as either instant payouts or staked rewards. High-XP memes can be converted into MNFTs (Meme NFTs) and traded on the marketplace or entered into Meme Battles.

---

## 5. Earning System

Users earn WALDOcoin based on their engagement metrics on social media. Every 25 likes unlocks a reward tier, and retweets increase the reward multiplier. A maximum of 10 posts per day are eligible, with a 1,000 likes cap per post.

| Tier | Likes Required | Retweets Required | Base Reward |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 25+ | 0+ | 1.00 WLO |
| 2 | 50+ | 5+ | 2.00 WLO |
| 3 | 100+ | 10+ | 5.00 WLO |
| 4 | 500+ | 50+ | 25.00 WLO |
| 5 | 1000+ | 100+ | 50.00 WLO |

When claiming allocations, users choose between instant payout with a 10% fee or staking with only a 5% fee plus a 15% bonus after one month. All fees contribute to the ecosystem: 10% of fees go to the NFT holder utility pool, 0.25% of fees are burned, and the remainder goes to the treasury.

| Method | Fee | Bonus | Example (50 WLO earned) |
|--------|-----|-------|--------------------------|
| Instant | 10% | None | Receive 45 WLO immediately |
| Staking | 5% | +15% | Receive 54.63 WLO after 1 month |

To prevent spam and maintain legitimacy, users must hold at least 3 XRP worth of WALDOcoin in their XRPL wallet to qualify for payouts.

---

## 6. XP Level System

The XP Level system fuels engagement and rewards long-term participation through a merit-based creator economy. Users earn 1 XP per 25 likes, 1 XP per 15 retweets, with a maximum of 10 XP per meme. Battle wins award 100 XP, losses give 25 XP, and voting participation earns 2 XP.

| Level | Title | XP Required | Image | Benefits |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Waldo Watcher | 0 | ![Level 1](level-1-watcher.png) | Base rates |

## 7. MNFT (Meme NFT) System

WALDOcoin introduces MNFTs, or Meme NFTs, a new asset class where memes become tradable digital assets with verifiable social metrics. An MNFT is a meme minted as an NFT on the XRPL, carrying verified engagement metrics like likes, retweets, and XP, along with an optional base value deposit, rarity classification based on performance, and creator royalties on secondary sales.

To mint an MNFT, users need a minimum of 60 XP and pay a 500 WLO minting fee. The base value deposit is optional, ranging from 0 to 100,000 WLO in 10,000 WLO increments. This deposit system allows creators to add intrinsic value to their MNFTs.

| Deposit Amount | Display | Total Cost |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| 0 WLO | No Deposit | 500 WLO (fee only) |
| 10,000 WLO | 10k WLO Locked | 10,500 WLO |
| 50,000 WLO | 50k WLO Locked | 50,500 WLO |
| 100,000 WLO | 100k WLO Locked | 100,500 WLO |

MNFTs are classified by rarity based on engagement metrics:

| Rarity | Engagement Score | Multiplier |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| 🟤 Common | 0-999 | 1.0× |
| 🔵 Rare | 1,000-4,999 | 2.0× |
| 🟣 Epic | 5,000-9,999 | 3.0× |
| 🟡 Legendary | 10,000+ | 5.0× |

---

## 8. MNFT Marketplace

The WALDO MNFT Marketplace is a professional trading platform for meme assets. Users can search and filter MNFTs by text, creator, or handle, browse by rarity, view real-time sales and listing updates in the activity feed, and access full MNFT details including engagement stats and locked WLO deposits.

To list an MNFT for sale, users navigate to the My MNFTs section, select their MNFT, set a price in WALDO, and confirm via their XUMM wallet.

| Action | Fee | Distribution |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Listing | Free | — |
| Sale | 5% | 2% burn, 3% treasury |
| Royalty | 5% | To original creator |

---

## 9. MNFT Holder Utility Access

Holding MNFTs unlocks exclusive ecosystem utility features through the tier system:

| Tier | MNFTs Required | Icon |
|------|----------------|------|
| None | 0 | ⚪ |
| Silver | 1-2 | 🥈 |
| Gold | 3-9 | 🥇 |
| Platinum | 10+ | 💎 |
| KING | Special KING NFT | 👑 |

| Utility Feature | Silver | Gold | Platinum | KING |
|-----------------|--------|------|----------|------|
| Lottery Tickets | 1× per NFT | 2× per NFT | 3× per NFT | **GUARANTEED** |
| XP Boost | +10% | +15% | +25% | +50% |
| Staking Bonus | +1% | +3% | +5% | +15% |
| DAO Voting Power | 1.1× | 1.25× | 1.5× | 3× |
| Claim Fee Discount | 5% | 10% | 15% | 25% |
| Minting Fee Discount | 15% | 30% | 50% | — |
| Battle Fee Discount | 10% | 20% | 30% | — |

### 🎰 Monthly Lottery System (NOT Revenue Sharing)

Instead of distributing allocations to all holders, WALDOcoin operates a **Monthly Lottery Drawing**:

**How It Works:**
- **5 random winners** are selected each month from all NFT holders
- **KING NFT holders** are **GUARANTEED winners** (auto-entry, split 50% of pool)
- Lottery winners split the remaining 50% of the pool equally
- Higher tiers = more lottery tickets = better odds (but not guaranteed)
- Winners selected via cryptographically secure randomization

**Lottery Ticket Distribution:**
| Tier | Tickets Per NFT | Example (5 NFTs) |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Silver (1-2 NFTs) | 1 ticket | 2 tickets max |
| Gold (3-9 NFTs) | 2 tickets | 10 tickets |
| Platinum (10+ NFTs) | 3 tickets | 15+ tickets |
| KING | N/A | **Auto-Winner** |

**Important Disclosure:** This is a prize drawing/giveaway, NOT revenue sharing. No purchase necessary beyond NFT ownership. NFT ownership provides automatic lottery entry. Pool size varies based on platform activity and is non-guaranteed. Past winners may win again. This does not constitute an investment or financial product.

---

## 10. Meme Battle Arena

The WALDOcoin Meme Battle Arena is a 24-hour showdown where creativity meets community. To initiate a battle, a user submits their meme along with a 150,000 WLO entry fee. An opponent can accept the challenge by submitting their own meme with a 75,000 WLO fee. The community then votes by staking 30,000 WLO per vote, and after 24 hours, the meme with the most votes wins.

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Winner | 55% of prize pool |
| Winning Voters | 45% of prize pool + losing side bets (split equally) |
| House Fee | 2% of voting pool |

House fee distribution: 10% to NFT holder utility pool, 0.25% burned, remainder to treasury.

| Outcome | XP Earned |
|---------|-----------|
| Battle Win | +100 XP |
| Battle Loss | +25 XP |
| Vote Participation | +2 XP |

Live leaderboards display the top users by total XP, most battle wins, top memes by engagement, and Hall of Fame winners.

---

## 11. Staking Portal

The WALDO Staking Portal offers flexible staking options with MNFT-boosted participation benefits. Staking allocations are variable, discretionary, and not guaranteed:

| Duration | Base APY | Lock Period |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 30 days | 12% | Fixed |
| 90 days | 18% | Fixed |
| 180 days | 25% | Fixed |
| 365 days | 45% | Fixed |

MNFT holders receive additional APY boosts on top of the base rates:

| MNFT Tier | APY Boost |
|-----------|-----------|
| Silver (1-2 MNFTs) | +1% |
| Gold (3-9 MNFTs) | +3% |
| Platinum (10+ MNFTs) | +5% |
| KING | +15% |

Long-term staking requires a minimum of 1,000 WLO and includes a 2% staking fee. Early withdrawal incurs a 15% penalty. The staking portal includes real-time APY display, staking history tracking, and full XUMM wallet integration.

---

## 12. DAO Governance

WALDOcoin is transitioning toward a fully decentralized governance model where the community makes key decisions about the ecosystem's future. Users need a minimum of 50,000 WLO to vote (1 vote per 50,000 WLO held). MNFT holdings provide additional voting power multipliers:

| Factor | Voting Multiplier |
|--------|-------------------|
| Base (per 50K WLO) | 1× |
| MNFT Silver | 1.1× |
| MNFT Gold | 1.25× |
| MNFT Platinum | 1.5× |
| MNFT KING | 3× |

The community can vote on feature updates and roadmap changes, ecosystem fund allocation, battle rule modifications, fee structure adjustments, and partnership approvals. The governance process begins with proposal submission by a community member, followed by a 3-7 day discussion period for feedback, then a 7-day voting period, and finally implementation of approved proposals.

---

## 13. Hall of Fame

The Hall of Fame immortalizes the greatest memes in WALDO history:

| Category | Description | Selection Criteria |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🏆 Best Meme Ever | All-time greatest | Highest XP ever achieved |
| 📅 Meme of the Month | Monthly champion | Highest XP that month |
| 📆 Meme of the Week | Weekly winner | Highest XP that week |

Hall of Fame recognition comes with permanent showcase on the Hall of Fame page, special badges on the meme's MNFT, creator spotlight features, bonus XP rewards, and priority visibility in the marketplace.

---

## 14. Memeology

Memeology is the professional meme creation studio for the WALDO ecosystem. It features a template library with pre-built meme formats, custom background uploads, multiple text tools with various fonts and styles, a WALDO-themed sticker library, and direct posting to X/Twitter.

## 15. Security & Fraud Prevention

WALDOcoin employs a multi-layered security framework to protect the ecosystem from abuse. AI-powered verification handles content originality checks, bot detection, engagement pattern analysis, and account age verification.

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Engagement Analysis | Detects irregular like/retweet patterns |
| Reputation Scoring | Weights engagement by user history |
| Real-Time Monitoring | Flags suspicious transactions |
| Blacklist System | Bans repeat offenders |

Wallet security is maintained through XRP holding requirements, wallet verification, transaction monitoring, and anti-sybil protections.

---

## 16. Ecosystem Sustainability

The ecosystem maintains sustainability through platform usage fees:

| Source | Fee | Distribution |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Meme Claims (Instant) | 10% | 10% to utility pool, 0.25% burn, remainder treasury |
| Meme Claims (Staked) | 5% | 10% to utility pool, 0.25% burn, remainder treasury |
| MNFT Minting | 500 WLO | Treasury |
| Marketplace Sales | 5% | 2% burn, 3% treasury |
| Battle Entry | 150K/75K WLO | Prize pool |
| Battle Voting | 30K WLO | Prize pool + 2% house fee |
| Staking Fees | 2% | 10% to utility pool, 0.25% burn, remainder treasury |

The tokenomics include several deflationary mechanisms: 0.25% burn on platform fees, burns from battle house fees, and periodic buyback programs. A discretionary ecosystem allocation pool may be made available to eligible NFT holders (Gold tier and above with 3+ MNFTs) based on platform conditions. Allocations are variable, capped, and may change or be discontinued at any time.

Treasury funds are used for ecosystem development, bug bounties, community grants, liquidity provisions, and marketing initiatives.

---

## 17. Technical Infrastructure

The backend is built on Node.js with Express.js, using Redis as a key-value store for data management. The platform is hosted on Render with auto-deploy from GitHub. All blockchain operations run on XRPL with XUMM/Xaman SDK for wallet integration.

The backend provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, meme submission and tracking, staking operations, MNFT minting and marketplace, battle arena operations, DAO voting, and leaderboards.

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on WordPress and Hostinger. Wallet connection uses XUMM WebSocket, with state management handled through LocalStorage and API calls.
