## 💰 Discretionary Ecosystem Allocation Pool

### How It Works

**IMPORTANT:** Allocations are discretionary, variable, non-guaranteed, and do not represent revenue sharing, profit participation, or investment returns. NFT ownership does not create a partnership or financial claim.

1. **Pool Funding**
   - Discretionary portion of platform fees (variable)
   - 0.25% of all fees are burned as a deflationary mechanism

2. **Periodic Distribution**
   - Distribution based on platform conditions
   - Pro-rata allocation based on tier priority
   - Allocations may change or be discontinued at any time

3. **Example**
   ```
   Total Pool: 10,000 WALDO
   Total Shares: 100
   
   Platinum (5 NFTs) = 5 shares → 500 WALDO
   Gold (3 NFTs) = 2 shares → 200 WALDO
   Silver (1 NFT) = 1 share → 100 WALDO
   ```

---

## 🚀 XP Boost System

### Automatic Application

When a user earns XP from memes:

```
Base XP: 10
Holder Tier: Gold (+15%)
Boosted XP: 10 × 1.15 = 11.5 → 11 XP
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Reach 60 XP faster for NFT minting
- ✅ Earn more rewards from memes
- ✅ Accelerate progression
- ✅ Compound with engagement metrics

| Gold | 9% | 4.75% |
| Silver | 9.5% | 4.75% |
| Non-Holder | 10% | 5% |

### Example

```
Claiming 1,000 WALDO (Instant)

Non-Holder: 900 WALDO (10% fee)
Gold Holder: 910 WALDO (9% fee)
