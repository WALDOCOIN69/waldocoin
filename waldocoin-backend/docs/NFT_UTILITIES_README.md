## 🎰 Monthly Lottery System (NOT Revenue Sharing)

### How It Works

**LEGAL NOTICE:** This is a prize drawing/giveaway, NOT revenue sharing. No purchase necessary beyond NFT ownership. NFT ownership = automatic lottery entry. This does not constitute an investment.

1. **Monthly Drawing**
   - 5 random winners selected from all NFT holders
   - KING holders are GUARANTEED winners (split 50% of pool)
   - Lottery winners split remaining 50% equally

2. **Lottery Tickets**
   | Tier | Tickets Per NFT |
   |------|-----------------|
   | Silver (1-2 NFTs) | 1 ticket |
   | Gold (3-9 NFTs) | 2 tickets |
   | Platinum (10+ NFTs) | 3 tickets |
   | KING | Auto-Winner |

3. **Prize Pool**
   - Variable based on platform activity (non-guaranteed)
   - 0.25% of all fees burned as deflationary mechanism
   - Pool size may change month to month

3. **Example**
   ```
   Total Pool: 10,000 WALDO
   Total Shares: 100
   
   Platinum (5 NFTs) = 5 shares → 500 WALDO
   Gold (3 NFTs) = 2 shares → 200 WALDO
   Silver (1 NFT) = 1 share → 100 WALDO
   ```

---

## 🚀 XP Boost System

### Automatic Application

When a user earns XP from memes:

```
Base XP: 10
Holder Tier: Gold (+15%)
Boosted XP: 10 × 1.15 = 11.5 → 11 XP
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Reach 60 XP faster for NFT minting
- ✅ Earn more rewards from memes
- ✅ Accelerate progression
- ✅ Compound with engagement metrics

## 💳 Claim Fee Discounts

### Fee Structure

| Tier | Instant Claim | Staked Claim |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Platinum | 8.5% | 4.25% |
| Gold | 9% | 4.75% |
| Silver | 9.5% | 4.75% |
| Non-Holder | 10% | 5% |

### Example

```
Claiming 1,000 WALDO (Instant)

Non-Holder: 900 WALDO (10% fee)
Gold Holder: 910 WALDO (9% fee)
Platinum Holder: 915 WALDO (8.5% fee)

Platinum saves: 15 WALDO per claim
```

## 🎟️ Battle Access & Discounts

## 📈 Staking Boost

### APY Multiplier

| Tier | Boost | Example (10% Base APY) |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| Platinum | +5% | 15% APY |
| Gold | +3% | 13% APY |
| Silver | +1% | 11% APY |

### Calculation

```
Base Staking APY: 10%
Holder Tier: Gold (+3%)
Final APY: 13%

Staking 1,000 WALDO for 1 year:
Non-Holder: 1,100 WALDO
