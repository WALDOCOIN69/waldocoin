## 💰 Revenue-Share Pool

### How It Works

1. **Funding Sources**
   - 2% of all WALDO transaction fees
   - 1% of staking pool profits
   - Royalties from secondary NFT sales

2. **Monthly Distribution**
   - Snapshot taken on 1st of each month
   - Pro-rata distribution based on tier shares
   - Automatic WALDO airdrop to wallets

3. **Example**
   ```
   Total Pool: 10,000 WALDO
   Total Shares: 100
   
   Platinum (5 NFTs) = 5 shares → 500 WALDO
   Gold (3 NFTs) = 2 shares → 200 WALDO
   Silver (1 NFT) = 1 share → 100 WALDO
   ```

---

## 🚀 XP Boost System

### Automatic Application

When a user earns XP from memes:

```
Base XP: 10
Holder Tier: Gold (+15%)
Boosted XP: 10 × 1.15 = 11.5 → 11 XP
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Reach 60 XP faster for NFT minting
