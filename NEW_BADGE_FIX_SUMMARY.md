# NEW Badge Timestamp Fix Summary

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

Early unlock notifications were showing as "NEW" indefinitely because:

1. **Missing Timestamps**: Old stakes completed before the timestamp system had no `unstakedAt`/`processedAt` fields
2. **No Viewed Tracking**: Once shown as NEW, they stayed NEW forever with no way to mark as seen
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users couldn't dismiss notifications they'd already seen

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Timestamp Logic**

**Before:**
```javascript
const isRecent = completionTime > 0 && (now - completionTime) < tenMinutesMs;
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Show NEW badge if:
// 1. Has valid timestamp AND within 10 minutes AND not yet viewed, OR
// 2. No valid timestamp (old stake) AND not yet viewed (assume it's new to user)
if (completionTime > 0 && !isNaN(completionTime)) {
  // Has valid timestamp - check if within 10 minutes and not viewed
  isRecent = (now - completionTime) < tenMinutesMs && !hasBeenViewed;
} else if (!hasBeenViewed) {
  // No valid timestamp (old stake) - show as new if not viewed, but only for first page load
  const sessionKey = `session_old_stakes_shown`;
  const oldStakesShown = sessionStorage.getItem(sessionKey) === 'true';
  if (!oldStakesShown) {
    isRecent = true;
    sessionStorage.setItem(sessionKey, 'true');
  }
}
```

### **2. User Viewing System**

#### **Local Storage Tracking**
- `viewed_stake_{stakeId}` - Tracks which stakes user has seen
- Persists across browser sessions
- Immediate feedback when marked as viewed

#### **Session Storage for Old Stakes**
- `session_old_stakes_shown` - Prevents old stakes from showing as NEW on every page load
- Resets each browser session
- Handles legacy stakes without timestamps

#### **Server-side Backup** (Optional)
- `POST /api/staking/mark-viewed` - Server-side tracking
- `GET /api/staking/viewed-status/:wallet/:stakeId` - Cross-device sync capability
- 30-day expiry for cleanup

### **3. Interactive NEW Badges**

#### **Clickable Badges**
```html
<span class="badge new" 
      style="background:#ff4444; color:white; margin-left:8px; animation:pulse 2s infinite; cursor:pointer;" 
      onclick="markStakeAsViewed('stake_id')" 
      title="Click to mark as viewed">NEW</span>
```

#### **Auto-dismiss Feature**
```javascript
// Auto-mark as viewed after 30 seconds if it has a valid recent timestamp
if (isRecent && completionTime > 0) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    markStakeAsViewed(s.stakeId);
  }, 30000);
}
```

### **4. New Backend Endpoints**

#### **Mark as Viewed**
```
POST /api/staking/mark-viewed
Body: { wallet, stakeId }
Response: { success: true, viewedAt: "2025-01-18T..." }
```

#### **Check Viewed Status**
```
GET /api/staking/viewed-status/:wallet/:stakeId
Response: { success: true, viewed: true, viewedAt: "2025-01-18T..." }
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Smart Badge Logic**
- ✅ **Recent stakes** (< 10 min): Show NEW until viewed
- ✅ **Old stakes** (no timestamp): Show NEW only on first page load
- ✅ **Already viewed**: Never show NEW again
- ✅ **Auto-dismiss**: Disappears after 30 seconds for recent stakes

### **User Control**
- ✅ **Click to dismiss**: Users can click NEW badge to mark as viewed
- ✅ **Immediate feedback**: Badge disappears instantly when clicked
- ✅ **Persistent**: Viewing status saved across sessions

### **Developer Tools**
- ✅ **Debug logging**: Detailed console logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Test functions**: `clearViewedStakes()` for testing
- ✅ **Server sync**: Optional cross-device synchronization

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **1. Test NEW Badge Behavior**

#### **For Recent Stakes:**
1. Create a test stake that completes in 2 minutes
2. Wait for completion
3. Refresh staking page
4. **Expected**: Stake shows NEW badge with pulsing animation
5. Click the NEW badge
6. **Expected**: Badge disappears immediately
7. Refresh page
8. **Expected**: No NEW badge (marked as viewed)

#### **For Old Stakes:**
1. Clear viewed markers: `clearViewedStakes()` in console
2. Refresh page
3. **Expected**: Old completed stakes show NEW badge
4. Refresh page again
5. **Expected**: Old stakes no longer show NEW (session tracking)

### **2. Test Auto-dismiss**
1. Complete a recent stake
2. Don't click the NEW badge
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. **Expected**: NEW badge disappears automatically

### **3. Test Console Functions**
```javascript
// Debug a specific stake
debugStakeMaturity('stake_id_here')

// Clear all viewed markers (for testing)
clearViewedStakes()

// Force refresh stakes
refreshStakes()

// Manually mark as viewed
markStakeAsViewed('stake_id_here')
```

## 📊 **Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ All early unlocks showed as NEW indefinitely
- ❌ No way to dismiss notifications
- ❌ Poor user experience with persistent false notifications
- ❌ Old stakes without timestamps always showed as NEW

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Only truly recent stakes show as NEW
- ✅ Users can dismiss notifications by clicking
- ✅ Auto-dismiss prevents notification fatigue
- ✅ Smart handling of legacy stakes without timestamps
- ✅ Persistent viewing state across sessions

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **WordPress/widgets/waldo-staking-widget.html**
   - Enhanced NEW badge logic with viewing system
   - Added `markStakeAsViewed()` function
   - Added `clearViewedStakes()` debug function
   - Improved timestamp handling for legacy stakes

2. **waldocoin-backend/routes/staking.js**
   - Added `POST /api/staking/mark-viewed` endpoint
   - Added `GET /api/staking/viewed-status/:wallet/:stakeId` endpoint
   - Server-side tracking for cross-device sync

## ✅ **Verification**

The NEW badge system now properly:
1. **Distinguishes** between recent and old notifications
2. **Allows user control** over notification dismissal
3. **Persists viewing state** across browser sessions
4. **Handles legacy data** gracefully
5. **Provides auto-dismiss** to prevent notification fatigue

**Result**: Users will only see NEW badges for genuinely recent early unlocks they haven't seen yet, with the ability to dismiss them manually or automatically.
